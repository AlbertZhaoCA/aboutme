# Albert's Blog

Welcome to my blog! I'm Albert, a Computer Science undergraduate. This blog is a place where I share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences related to computer science and my journey as a student.  

TBH, I don't want to cover only CS stuff, but as you can see, I am a CS undergraduate. You know the purpose of most CS undergraduate writing a blog: yeah, absolutely passionate. However, I want to treat it as one of my personal projects to show my understanding of computer science especially software engineering to get a internship and, finally, a job üòÇ.   
Hope one day I can write something else (maybe something about language learnign cause I am interested in human language but can only use English and Chinese,HAHAHA, I can't even say I can speek mandarin flutelyüòµ‚Äçüí´, yeah, I come from Sichuan), but if I wrote something not about CS and offense you it is my fault.
